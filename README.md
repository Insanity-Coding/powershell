Powershell code

This powershell script is for administrating Exchange mailboxes and users via a user friendly UI and without caching times of ECP.

Lines to edit/read before usage:
  
	209 - Edit the primary SMTP suffix you want to use, otherwise the creation of a distribution list will fail
  
	212 - Edit a copy & paste solution if you want for your ticket tool (if needed)
  
Feel free to edit the script depending on your needs.

Cheers,
  Insanity
